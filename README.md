1. COMPUTER: A computer is an electronic device that takes raw data from the user and proceses it. It can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of logical or arithmetical operations. A computer is mainly devided into three parts-
A. Computation-

A.1 CPU: A CPU stands for central processing unit, which is the primary component of the computer that acts as its control center.

A.2 DPU: DPU stands for data processing unit. A DPU is a specialized processor that helps the CPU with tasks like networking, security and storage. A DPU is also called a IPU (infrastructure processing unit) or SmartNIC. leading provideres od DPUs are intel and AMD.

A.3 GPU: GPU stands for graphics processing unit.A GPU is an elecronic circuit that can perform mathmatical calculations at high speed. Computing tasks like graphics rendering, machine learaning (ML), and video editing require the application of similar mathematical operations on a large dataset.

A.4 APU: APU stands for accelerated processing unit. A APU is a processor that combines a CPU(Central Processing Unit) and GPU(Graphics Processing Unit) into a one chip.

A.5 NPU: NPU stands for neural processing unit. A NPU is a specialized procesor that accelerated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.

A.6 TPU: TPU stands for Tensor processing unit. A TPU is a custom made application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by google to speed up machine learning workload. TPUs are designed for neural networks and are known for their high throughput and parallelism.

A.7 FPGA: A field-programmable gates array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can  be recognised after manufacturing to suit specific needs. FPGAs are often used in applicatoion that require high data processing ir transactions, such as financial trading, molecular dynamics, bioscience.

B. MEMORY AND STORAGE-  the electronic components that stores the data and instructions for a computer to access quickly. It is used to store information that the computer's processor needs to run application and open files. Memory is what your computer use to store data temporarily, while storage is where you save files permanently.

c. 2^30 = 1gb
and IPv6 is 2^128

IP address is of 32 bits or 4 bytes like 192.168.x.y each no. takes 8 bits like in this case it has 4 numbers written in form of a.b.x.y and this 8bit (one number) called OCTET.

17. DEVOPS- DevOps is a software development practice that combines the words "development" and "operation" to describe the process of integrating these two disciplines into a single, continuous process. DevOps can help organizations deliver applications and services faster by:

Breaking down silos - DevOps unifies people, processes, and technology across traditionally siloed roles like development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security.

Enabling collaboration - DevOps allows coordination and collaboration between teams that have different priorities, tasks and timelines.

Accelerating delivery- DevOps can speed up the delivery of code to production by incorporating automated, prescheduled code tests as the application code is being written or updated.

Improving products - DevOps can help organizations evolve and improve products at a faster pace.

21. The 7 layers of OSI model-

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33887778-661f-441c-bcfa-accc1cc64fe7)

*Layer 7 : Application Layer - The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients.

*Layer 6 : Presentation Layer - The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compresses data so it is received correctly on the other end.

*Layer 5 : Session Layer - The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices.

*Layer 4 : Transport Layer - The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end.

*Layer 3 : Networking Layer - The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end.

*Layer 2 : Data-Link-Layer - The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network.

*Layer 1 : Physical Layer - The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes.

22. Application - 
An application program (software application, or application, or app for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself, typically to be used by end-users. Word processors, media players, and accounting software are examples. 

23.INTERNET- A communication system that connects computers and computer networks all over the world.

24. DNS- Domain Name System (DNS)  is  a network of computers that converts web addresses into IP addresses.

25. IP- An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the internet.
