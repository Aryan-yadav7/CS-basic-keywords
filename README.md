1. COMPUTER: A computer is an electronic device that takes raw data from the user and proceses it. It can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of logical or arithmetical operations. A computer is mainly devided into three parts-
A. Computation-

A.1 CPU: A CPU stands for central processing unit, which is the primary component of the computer that acts as its control center.

A.2 DPU: DPU stands for data processing unit. A DPU is a specialized processor that helps the CPU with tasks like networking, security and storage. A DPU is also called a IPU (infrastructure processing unit) or SmartNIC. leading provideres od DPUs are intel and AMD.

A.3 GPU: GPU stands for graphics processing unit.A GPU is an elecronic circuit that can perform mathmatical calculations at high speed. Computing tasks like graphics rendering, machine learaning (ML), and video editing require the application of similar mathematical operations on a large dataset.

A.4 APU: APU stands for accelerated processing unit. A APU is a processor that combines a CPU(Central Processing Unit) and GPU(Graphics Processing Unit) into a one chip.

A.5 NPU: NPU stands for neural processing unit. A NPU is a specialized procesor that accelerated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.

A.6 TPU: TPU stands for Tensor processing unit. A TPU is a custom made application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by google to speed up machine learning workload. TPUs are designed for neural networks and are known for their high throughput and parallelism.

A.7 FPGA: A field-programmable gates array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can  be recognised after manufacturing to suit specific needs. FPGAs are often used in applicatoion that require high data processing ir transactions, such as financial trading, molecular dynamics, bioscience.

A.8 ASIC: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit is a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general purpose use. For example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specially build to perform tha hashing calculations required for mining.

A.9 CISC: A Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) processor is a type of computer architecture that uses a large set of instructions to perform complex tasks.

A.10 RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer is a microprocessor that uses a small set of simple instruction to perform tasks.

A.11 RISC-V: RISC-V is an open source instruction set architecture (ISA) that is used to design custom processors for a variety of applications. It is based on principles of reduced instruction set computers (RISC) and is pronounced "risc-five">

A.12 SOC- A system on a chip (SOC) is an integrated circuit that contains most or all of a computer or other electronic system's components on a single chip.


B. MEMORY AND STORAGE-  the electronic components that stores the data and instructions for a computer to access quickly. It is used to store information that the computer's processor needs to run application and open files. Memory is what your computer use to store data temporarily, while storage is where you save files permanently.

TYPES-

B.1 PRIMARY- Also known as main memory, this is the computer's main memory that stores data, programs and instructions that are currently in use like RAM>

B.2 SECONDARY- This type of memory provides permanent storage for data that doesn't erase when the computer is turned off. Its often ussed for backing up data, disaster recovery and storing critical data for long periods of time like harddisk.

C. NETWORK- A computer network is a group of devices that exchange data and resources with each other. Network can be connected using cables or wireless media.

C.1 INTERNET- A communication system that connects computers and computer networks all over the world.

C.2 DNS- Domain Name System (DNS)  is  a network of computers that converts web addresses into IP addresses.

C.3 IP- An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the internet.

TYPES

1. PRIVATE- LAN(INTERNET) has 3 types (1) 10.x.y.z (2) 172.x.y.z (3) 192.168.x.y

2. PUBLIC- WAN(INTERNET)

C.4 MAC- A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier for a device's network interface controller (NIC) that is used in network communicaions. It is also known as hardware address, physical address or burned-in address (BIA).

C.4 PORT- Port addressess, or port numbers are 16 bit unsigned integers that are appended to an IP address to direct internet traffic to a specific process or service.

2.OSI- The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the function of networking system.
