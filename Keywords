1. COMPUTER: A computer is an electronic device that takes raw data from the user and proceses it. It can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of logical or arithmetical operations. A computer is mainly devided into three parts-
A. Computation-
A.1 CPU: A CPU stands for central processing unit, which is the primary component of the computer that acts as its control center. 
A.2 DPU: DPU stands for data processing unit. A DPU is a specialized processor that helps the CPU with tasks like networking, security and storage. A DPU is also called a IPU (infrastructure processing unit) or SmartNIC. leading provideres od DPUs are intel and AMD.
A.3 GPU: GPU stands for graphics processing unit.A GPU is an elecronic circuit that can perform mathmatical calculations at high speed. Computing tasks like graphics rendering, machine learaning (ML), and video editing require the application of similar mathematical operations on a large dataset.
A.4 APU: APU stands for accelerated processing unit. A APU is a processor that combines a CPU(Central Processing Unit) and GPU(Graphics Processing Unit) into a one chip.
A.5 NPU: NPU stands for neural processing unit. A NPU is a specialized procesor that accelerated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.
A.6 TPU: TPU stands for Tensor processing unit. A TPU is a custom made application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by google to speed up machine learning workload. TPUs are designed for neural networks and are known for their high throughput and parallelism.
